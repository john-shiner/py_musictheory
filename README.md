# Based on scaletheorymapper

Basic python3 framework for mapping chords and scale types to keys

Uses simpleaudio package for tone generation.  Required extra routines to map scale/note theory to frequency sequences.

Backlog shortlist:
- abstract chord types
- chord sequence player (1, 4, 5, etc.)
- chord sequence scripting language and UI
- input/output (load chord sequences, output mapped scales, chords, substitutions
